# DCRGAN-TMM

# prepare dataset
Download the [data](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-multimodal-computing/research/zero-shot-learning/zero-shot-learning-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/) and uncompress it to the folder '../data'.

## Reproduce results
run demo.sh for CUB, AWA1, APY, SUN dataset
```shell
shell demo.sh
```

## Train your own SRN
Of course, you can re-train a your own SRN
```shell
shell pretrainSRN.sh
```
